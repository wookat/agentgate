Skill scanning covers more real-world layouts: `allowed-tools` YAML flow lists (`["Read", "Bash"]`) on a continuation line are now parsed (previously a silent miss), and slash-command / agent markdown under `skills/`, `commands/`, or `agents/` of agent config trees and Claude Code plugin directories (`plugins/<name>/...`) is scanned with the skill rules.
