`config convert` supports three new client formats: `windsurf` (remote servers via `serverUrl`), `cline` (`disabled` flag mapped to enabled state, `autoApprove` warned as lossy), and `gemini-cli` (`url` = SSE vs `httpUrl` = streamable HTTP preserved in both directions). Default-path auto-discovery picks up the new clients too.
