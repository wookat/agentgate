`scan --live`, `lock`, `diff`, and `ci` now connect to remote MCP servers (`url` configs) via Streamable HTTP with an SSE fallback for legacy servers, passing configured `headers`. Remote tool surfaces are scanned for poisoning and pinned in the lockfile just like stdio servers; previously every remote server was skipped as "analyzed statically only".
