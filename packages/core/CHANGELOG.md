# mcp-agentgate-core

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e69fe1b: `agentgate scan` cross-checks configured server packages against the bundled AgentGate MCP advisory database (`MCPA-*`) — new `AG-SC-003` finding covering RCE/SSRF/path-traversal/auth advisories beyond malware, with SemVer range comparison for pinned versions; works fully offline. New core exports `MCPA_ADVISORIES`, `matchMcpaAdvisories()`, `scoreMcpaMatches()`. Also fixed: `agentgate --version` reported a hardcoded `0.1.0`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 62546bd: Cross-server analysis: `scan --live` now analyzes every inspected server's tool surface together.

  - `AG-TF-001` toxic flows: tools that read private data + tools that send data out across different servers = exfiltration flow (medium); plus a tool ingesting untrusted external content = complete toxic flow (high)
  - `AG-XS-001` shadowing/hijack: duplicate tool names across servers (high); a tool instructing the agent about another server's tool (critical)
  - new core API `scanConfiguration(surfaces)` and rule hook `checkConfiguration`
  - fixed: the `$schema` meta-URL in zod-generated input schemas no longer gives every tool a network capability; sibilant third-person verbs ("Fetches", "Searches") now match capability patterns

- 1afb7d5: `agentgate deps` checks dependencies against OSV.dev known-malware advisories: a package with a `MAL-*` advisory (GitHub Advisory DB / OSV malicious-packages, including the malicious MCP-server package wave) is a critical `AG-DP-006` finding with the advisory link. Degrades to a warning offline. New core API `queryOsvMalware()` / `scoreAdvisories()`.
- 1afb7d5: `agentgate scan` checks configured server packages (launched via npx/pnpx/bunx/uvx/pipx) against OSV.dev known-malware advisories — new `AG-SC-002` finding, with pinned-version comparison for compromised-release advisories. New core export `serverPackageRef()`.

### Patch Changes

- 078003e: Repo scans report dynamic code-execution primitives (`eval(`, `new Function(`, child_process spawns) only in files that are part of an MCP server — that is where model-controlled input can reach them; flagging every one in ordinary application code buried the findings that matter (microsoft/vscode: 67 → 5 medium RCE findings, with a real catch surviving).
- b92eba7: Secret-shaped strings found in test/fixture/example paths are reported at `low` with a "likely a deliberate fake; confirm" note instead of `high` — redaction tests deliberately contain such strings (microsoft/vscode: 10 → 1 high credential findings, the survivor being a private-key marker in shipping code).
- b65046c: Known-malware advisory comparisons now resolve installed versions from lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock` v1, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`) as well as `node_modules`, so compromised-release advisories get a definitive severity on uninstalled checkouts. New core export `loadResolvedVersions()`.
- 6eb8e25: Repo-scan rules now receive posix-style relative paths on every OS, so test/fixture-path heuristics work on Windows.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- e77f876: `deps` false-positive elimination and output polish (benchmark round 1 vs npm audit / osv-scanner / socket CLI): first-party Python modules and imports inside comments/docstrings are no longer reported; nonexistent imports found only under test/example paths downgrade to `low`; unparseable manifests now warn loudly (stderr + report `warnings[]`) instead of passing silently; findings tables print per-rule doc links; SARIF rules carry `helpUri`; finding targets mark import-only refs with an `(import)` suffix.
- 08184ba: Round 2 benchmark (vs mcp-scan / Snyk Agent Scan, microsoft/vscode as the real-world subject):

  - `scan --live` now lists the stdio commands it is about to start and asks for confirmation; non-interactive sessions must pass `--yes` (nothing is started otherwise)
  - a static scan that skips stdio servers warns that their live tool surface was not inspected instead of reporting a clean bill
  - rule recall: third-person tool descriptions ("Executes arbitrary shell commands") are now matched by the RCE, overprivileged and SSRF rules
  - rule precision on real repos (vscode: 478 → 89 findings): `.exec(` is no longer a code-execution primitive, a bare `child_process` mention needs a nearby exec/spawn call, `curl|sh` in non-executable files is medium, and emoji ZWJ/flag/Nerd-Font/BOM characters are no longer "hidden instructions" (zero-width → low, Trojan-Source bidi → high, now with codepoint and line)
  - `deps` collapses a fully unreachable registry into one warning instead of one finding per package

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6598a8b: New `agentgate deps` command: detect AI-hallucinated (slopsquatted) and typosquatted dependencies across npm and PyPI. Collects names from package.json / requirements\*.txt / pyproject.toml and source imports, verifies existence against live registries, risk-scores existing packages (rules AG-DP-001..005), and gates with `--fail-on` — table/JSON/SARIF output, `--offline` degradation, GitHub Action + pre-commit integration.
